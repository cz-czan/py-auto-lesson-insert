# py-auto-lesson-insert
Small program meant to insert ORPEG lessons into Google Calendar via python3 selenium + chromedriver, no apis used.
Program developed about 15 months ago, may not actually work now due to security updates in browsers/services. Depends on OS/browser. Needs to be updated/fixed.
